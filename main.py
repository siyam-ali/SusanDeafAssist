# Hello there! Susan is a Chat Bot designed to assist deaf people (those who have trouble hearing) to collaborate with their friends, family, or co-workers.
# This project uses the SpeechRecognition and streamlit libraries to function. streamlit is used for the user interface and to display the converted speech to the deaf person.
