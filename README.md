# Susan is happy to meet you! ðŸ¤– 

Susan is a Chat Bot that I designed to assist deaf people with communicating with others. She uses the Python SpeechRecognition library to understand and process speech from others, and convert that speech to text which is displayed to the deaf person using the streamlit library. 

The users can continue to use Susan until Ctrl+C is pressed to escape the program. The person who speaks should speak loud and clear so that Susan can do their best to convert their speech to text.

## How to Launch the Project Locally:

1.) Install packages from requirements.txt with pip install -r requirements.txt in your shell. You can also use your own preferred method.

2.) Open the project in your development environment.

3.) If you prefer to use a virtual environment directory to keep this project independent, do so accordingly.

4.) Run the project with "streamlit run main.py" in your environment's terminal.

5.) A locally hosted webpage should open, displaying the interaction with Susan.

## How to use Susan?

The program will continue to run until user presses Ctrl+C to exit. This allows for no time restrictions of conversation.

### Thanks for viewing my project!
